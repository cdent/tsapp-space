`tsapp` provides a single script that takes multiple commands. Running 
`tsapp help` will list the relevant commands. The following lists 
available commands. Those commands which are not yet completed are marked
with `TBC`.

Note that the commands are designed to allow easy creation of aliases and
to otherwise be combined in a useful fashion using the shell.
