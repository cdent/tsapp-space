`tsapp push <bag name> [<tiddler title>]`

Push (via HTTP `PUT`) all the local assets to the target server, in the
bag named by `<bag name>`. If the bag does not end with `_private` or
`_public`, then `_public` will be appended.

Files that have a `.html` or `.tid` extension on the source file will
have the extension removed on the target.

If `<tiddler title>` is provided, just that one tiddler will be pushed.
