tsapp provides a tool, `tsapp`, for creating browser-based applications
for use with [TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com/). Such applications are
made of one or more html files along with one or more CSS and JavaScript
files for presenting and access the tiddler data that lives in TiddlySpace.

The combination can be very useful for rapid development of web applications
that need a persistent but simple data store with a clean, robust API.
