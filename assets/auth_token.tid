Auth secret for accessing private resources on the target server. No default.
Set it with the `auth` command or copy in the tiddlyweb_user cookie.

The auth_token property will also be set (only if it does not exist already)
when the server intercepts login requests to `/challenge/

If a POST to `/logout` is made and the auth_token exists, it will be removed
from the configuration in the local directory.
