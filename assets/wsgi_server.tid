The name of a python module containing a `start_server` method which,
when passed `config`, will start a web server hosting the proxy
application. Originally this was the server provided by the `wsgiref`
module in the Python stdlib, but this proved to be annoyingly slow.
Now `CherryPyWSGIServer` is used. An example of using the original
server [is availble](https://gist.github.com/cdent/5564147).
